        <p>We hope you love shopping with Luma. Here are our delivery and returns policies to help make sure we meet your expectations. <a href="{{store url="contact"}}">Contact Us.</a></p>

    <h2 class="customer-font-upper">Shipping and Delivery</h2>
    <p>Shipping and Delivery is the charge for internet order processing, item selection, packaging, transport and handling. We donâ€™t guarantee delivery times, but we do our best to provide accurate estimates.</p>

    <p>Deliveries occur only on weekdays. Shipping and Delivery charges are subject to change and are determined when you order. Estimated delivery time assumes orders are placed before 12:00 noon (PST). Orders you place with Luma late on Friday or on Saturday will not be processed until Monday. Charges may be added to orders with Priority, Overnight and International shipping if we try unsuccessfully to deliver your order more than once.</p>

    <p>Delivery addresses in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Guam should add an additional $5.00 charge for standard Shipping & Delivery. Orders arrive in 7 to 9 business days when ordered before 12:00 noon (PST).</p>

    <h2 class="customer-font-upper">Returns and Replacements</h2>
    <p>We want you to be completely happy with your Luma order. If for any reason you are not satisfied, we will gladly accept your timely return of unworn, unwashed, or defective merchandise. Used merchandise cannot be returned unless defective. Returned merchandise should include the vendor packaging and tags and be in the same condition as when it was received. A pickup and/or restock fee may apply. Merchandise must be returned within 30 days of receipt of merchandise.</p>

    <h3 class="customer-font-upper">Returning Gifts</h3>
    <p>When returning a gift, a Luma Gift Card will be issued to the gift recipient for the amount of the returned merchandise. The card can be used for purchases from any Luma store, and online. In compliance with Federal law, for gifts valued at more than $2,000.00, the recipient will receive a check rather than an Luma Gift Card.</p>

    <h3 class="customer-font-upper">Returning Merchandise by Mail</h3>
    <p>On the back of the packing slip enclosed with your Luma order, please note the reason(s) for return and whether you wish to  exchange the item(s) or receive a credit/refund (depending on the original form of  payment).</p>
    <p>Enclose the return section of the packing slip with your item(s). Please use one  of the return labels provided on the front of your packing slip to ensure proper  return address and credit information. Restricted items must be returned using  ground transportation.</p>
    <p>Please allow 10 to 14 days for Luma to process your return.</p>
