<p class="aboutus-txt-align">Samurai Sportswear was born from a passion for great kits. When the owner Terry Sands set
    about finding kit for his Samurai International Rugby Sevens teamsâ€™ debut at the Amsterdam Sevens back in 1996 nothing
    he found matched his expectations, so he designed the kit himself and the Samurai Sportswear brand was born, J20 Sports
    have been their distributor for the Middle East for over 6 years.</p>
